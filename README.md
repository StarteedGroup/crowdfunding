Starteed SELF PHP API wrapper
--
Official Starteed SELF PHP API wrapper: help to read public data of Starteed SELF campaigns.

Widely inspired by [Sparkpost PHP API wrapper](https://github.com/SparkPost/php-sparkpost).

Still in **alpha** version.

Authentication is provided with API key: contact our support to get one.


## Installation

Install Composer first

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Starteed SELF requires a php-http client: we suggest Guzzle6.

    composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter

Next install the package.

    composer require starteed/crowdfunding


## Setting up a Request Adapter
Because of dependency collision, we have opted to use a request adapter rather than requiring a request library.
This means that your application will need to pass in a request adapter to the constructor of the Starteed SELF Library
(we chose HttpPlug). Please visit their repo for a list of supported clients and adapters. If you don't currently use a
request library, you will need to require one and create a client from it and pass it along. The example below uses the
GuzzleHttp Client Library.

A Client can be setup like so:

    <?php
    
    require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    
    use GuzzleHttp\Client;
    use Starteed\SelfCrowdfunding;
    use Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client as GuzzleAdapter;
    
    $http_client = new GuzzleAdapter(new Client);
    $starteed = new Crowdfunding($http_client, [
        'platform' => 'myplatform.starteed.com'
    ]);
    
    ?>

## Localization
Localization is provided by Accept-Language header: you can pass a dash or underscore value (e.g.: it_IT or it-IT) or
just the language ISO code in the configuration array.

    $http_client = new GuzzleAdapter(new Client);
    $starteed = new Crowdfunding($http_client, [
        'platform' => 'myplatform.starteed.com',
        'language' => 'en_US'
    ]);

*Note that if the language locale is not available all the results will be translated with default language as fallback*
